Today I want to show how you can deploy code on AWS EC2 using CodeShip Basic. To do this, I will use the integration of Codeship with AWS CodeDeploy.
CodeShip Configuration First you need to add a repository to CodeShip and go to the Deploy page Add a branch from which code will be deployed to ec2. In my case, the branch is master. Once the branch is added you need to scroll down to the Deployment section.</description></item></channel></rss>
