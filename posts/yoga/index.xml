      <description>I’ve decided to pivot from writing about IT to exploring my passion for yoga, which I’ve practiced for nearly a decade. Unlike other sports, yoga has remained a constant in my life. Recently, I discovered Inner Dimension and began a 200-hour yoga teacher training course. I’ll be sharing insights and reflections from this journey. Yoga is more than just physical poses; it’s about harmonizing breath and movement to achieve mental clarity. It offers tools to manage inner turmoil and maintain peace. Join me as I delve deeper into the essence of yoga.</description>
