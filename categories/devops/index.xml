Today we will make a script for automatic resizing of EBS volume using golang and AWS SDK version 2. To do this, I need to perform a few steps: get a list of volumes, filter those volumes in which the amount of free memory is less than the threshold, find the ebs id that corresponds to this volume. Resize by a specified percentage and increase the disk size on the file system.</description></item><item><title>Failed Asg Event Notification</title><link>/2021/01/03/failed-asg-event-notification/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 17:57:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>/2021/01/03/failed-asg-event-notification/</guid><description>Hello!
Today I want to show how with the help of AWS Lambda and Golang you can get messages in slack when Autoscaling could not create an Ec2 server. Deploy I automate using serverless.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the installation of node and serverless. I use nvm to manage node versions.
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash nvm install v14.15.3 npm install -g serverless I will create a folder and initialize the go module in it.</description></item><item><title>Import Grafana Dashboards With Go</title><link>/2020/12/23/import-grafana-dashboards-with-go/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 23:18:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/23/import-grafana-dashboards-with-go/</guid><description>Hello!
In the previous post I showed how you can export dashboards from Grafana. Now let&amp;rsquo;s see how they can be imported into Grafana.
As always at the beginning there will be imports and main function
package grafana import ( &amp;#34;context&amp;#34; &amp;#34;encoding/json&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;io/ioutil&amp;#34; &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.com/grafana-tools/sdk&amp;#34; ) func main() { } I will add some parameters:
var ( filesInDir []os.FileInfo rawBoard []byte err error grafanaURL string apiKey string directory string ) filesInDir will store all dashboards from the file system.</description></item><item><title>Export Grafana Dashboards With Go</title><link>/2020/12/19/export-grafana-dashboards-with-go/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2020 18:27:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/19/export-grafana-dashboards-with-go/</guid><description>Hello!
Let&amp;rsquo;s check how you can use go to export dashboards from Grafana. For interaction with Grafana I use sdk. Sdk can be installed using go get github.com/grafana-tools/sdk.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start writing code. At the beginning of the file will be the package, import and main function
package main import ( &amp;#34;context&amp;#34; &amp;#34;encoding/json&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.com/grafana-tools/sdk&amp;#34; ) func main() { } ) I will add some parameters:

Today I will show how you can filter ebs snapshots by date with golang.
To begin with I will create a folder and in it, I will initialize the go module
mkdir snapshotFilter cd snapshotFilter go mod init snapshotFilter You need to create main.go which will contain the code. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the main function and imports
package main import ( &amp;#34;flag&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; &amp;#34;sort&amp;#34; &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/ec2&amp;#34; ) func main() { sess := session.</description></item><item><title>Custom Dns for Github Pages</title><link>/2020/11/02/custom-dns-for-github-pages-copy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 16:19:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>/2020/11/02/custom-dns-for-github-pages-copy/</guid><description>Hello!
Today I want to show how you can add custom DNS for the GithubPages site.
This requires a few steps. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with domain name registration. I chose Namecheap to register my domain name. Open Namecheap website and in the search you need to enter the name you want to buy. Once you found what you are looking for and add it to your card.
It says Taken next to my domain name because I already bought it.</description></item><item><title>Deploy Hugo With Github Actions and Pages</title><link>/2020/10/21/deploy-hugo-with-github-actions-and-pages/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 20:19:26 +0300</pubDate><guid>/2020/10/21/deploy-hugo-with-github-actions-and-pages/</guid><description>Hello!
I want to show how you can deploy a hugo website in GitHub Pages using github actions. That&amp;rsquo;s how I build my site.
Install Hugo Hugo can be downloaded from GitHub. Put the binary in the desired location.
GitHub setup In github you need to create two repositories, one is for .md files and the theme (content-mpostument in my case) and another will be used for GitHub Pages in which will be stored generated website with hugo (mpostument.</description></item><item><title>Nightfall Dlp Configuration</title><link>/2020/09/30/nightfall-dlp-configuration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 21:52:21 +0300</pubDate><guid>/2020/09/30/nightfall-dlp-configuration/</guid><description>Hi there!
I want to talk today about DLP Nightfall. The Nightfall DLP Action scans your code commits upon Pull Request for sensitive information - like credentials &amp;amp; secrets, PII, credit card numbers &amp;amp; more - and posts review comments to your code hosting service automatically. The Nightfall DLP Action is intended to be used as a part of your CI to simplify the development process, improve your security, and ensure you never accidentally leak secrets or other sensitive information via an accidental commit.</description></item><item><title>Deploy to ec2 with codedship</title><link>/2020/09/16/deploy-to-ec2-with-codeship/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 20:24:40 +0300</pubDate><guid>/2020/09/16/deploy-to-ec2-with-codeship/</guid><description>Hi there!
Today I want to show how you can deploy code on AWS EC2 using CodeShip Basic. To do this, I will use the integration of Codeship with AWS CodeDeploy.
CodeShip Configuration First you need to add a repository to CodeShip and go to the Deploy page Add a branch from which code will be deployed to ec2. In my case, the branch is master. Once the branch is added you need to scroll down to the Deployment section.</description></item><item><title>Get Lambdas in Vpc With Go</title><link>/2020/09/01/get-lambdas-in-vpc-with-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 17:40:16 +0300</pubDate><guid>/2020/09/01/get-lambdas-in-vpc-with-go/</guid><description>Hi there!
Today I want to tell you how with go you can get a list of all AWS Lambda that are in the VPC. First you need to install golang. The latest version can be downloaded from the official website.
Once golang is installed, create a folder for the scripts mkdir awsscripts
Next you need to initialize the go.mod file. This file stores all the dependencies on external packages, and at the same time will make the go code module.</description></item><item><title>Build Dotnet Core With Travis</title><link>/2020/08/31/build-dotnet-core-with-travis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:24:40 +0300</pubDate><guid>/2020/08/31/build-dotnet-core-with-travis/</guid><description>Hello!
Today I want to show how you can build and deploy .net core with Travis.
To get started, you need to create a Travis account. This requires you to login with your GitHub account. .travis.yml Configuration The next step is to create a .travis.yml file in the root of the repository.
Example of my configuration file:
language: csharp mono: none dotnet: 3.1.4 solution: awstaghelper.sln install: - dotnet restore script: - dotnet build --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --output win-x64 - dotnet build --configuration Release --runtime win-x86 --output win-x86 - dotnet build --configuration Release --runtime linux-x64 --output linux-x64 - dotnet build --configuration Release --runtime osx-x64 --output osx-x64 before_deploy: - zip -r9 win-x64.</description></item></channel></rss>
