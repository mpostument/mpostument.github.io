Following a well-thought-out plan I discovered on Reddit, specifically this invaluable post &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/">https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/&lt;/a>, I embarked on my artistic journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first topic that caught my attention was Figure Drawing by Proko. Throughout the week, I immersed myself in the captivating first lesson on Gesture, dedicating time each day to practice. The lesson itself was a treasure trove, featuring a variety of videos. One video offered insightful guidance on drawing techniques, while the next showcased the author&amp;rsquo;s skillful demonstrations, accompanied by detailed explanations. Additionally, there were captivating videos of the author&amp;rsquo;s drawings, ranging from quick 30-second sketches to more elaborate 2-minute masterpieces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t help but share a glimpse of my progress over this week. Although only a selection of my works is showcased here due to their sheer abundance, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that I still consider them somewhat mediocre. However, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to keep in mind that this is just the beginning of my journey, and I eagerly await the transformative growth that lies ahead.&lt;/p>
